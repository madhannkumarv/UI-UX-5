3. Creating Scenarios
Selected User Story:
As Raj, I want to book an appointment quickly, so that I don't waste time navigating through the app.
Scenario:
Raj, a 32-year-old software engineer, just finished a busy day at work and feels a headache coming on.
He opens the hospital app on his phone while sitting at a noisy coffee shop.
Feeling tired and impatient, Raj wants to find the earliest available neurologist appointment without scrolling
through complex menus.
Using the app's smart quick-book feature, he enters his symptom "headache," selects a suggested
neurologist,
and confirms the earliest available slot in under 3 minutes.
He feels relieved and grateful for the simple and fast booking process.
